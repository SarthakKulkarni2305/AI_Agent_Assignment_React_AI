In\r\na network, two or more nodes are connected by a physical link or two or more networks\r\nare connected by one or more nodes. A network is a collection of devices connected to\r\neach other to allow the sharing of data.\r\n\u25cf\r\nNetwork Topology : Network topology specifies the layout of a computer network. It\r\nshows how devices and cables are connected to each other.\r\nTypes of Network Topology :\r\n\u25cf\r\nStar :\r\n\u25cf\r\nStar topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected\r\nto a single device known as a central device.\r\n\u25cf\r\nStar topology requires more cable compared to other topologies.\r\nTherefore, it is more robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect a\r\nspecific computer connected to this cable.\r\n\u25cf\r\nIf the central device is damaged, then the whole network fails.\r\n\u25cf\r\nStar topology is very easy to install, manage and troubleshoot. It is\r\ncommonly used in office and home networks.\r\n\u25cf\r\nRing :\r\n1.\r\nRing topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly connected to two\r\nor more nodes and thus, forming a single continuous path for the transmission.\r\n2.\r\nIt does not need any central server to control the connectivity among the nodes.\r\n3.\r\nIf the single node is damaged, then the whole network fails.\r\n4.\r\nRing topology is very rarely used as it is expensive, difficult to install and\r\nmanage.\r\n5.\r\nExamples of Ring topology are SONET network, SDH network, etc.\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nBus :\r\n1.\r\nBus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a\r\nsingle cable known as a central cable or bus.\r\n2.\r\nIt acts as a shared communication medium, i.e., if any device wants to send the\r\ndata to other devices, then it will send the data over the bus which in turn sends\r\nthe data to all the attached devices.\r\n3.\r\nBus topology is useful for a small number of devices.\r\n4.\r\nAs if the bus is damaged then the whole network fails.\r\n\u25cf\r\nMesh :\r\n1.\r\nMesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually\r\nconnected to other nodes.\r\n2.\r\nIt does not need any central switch or hub to control the connectivity among the\r\nnodes.\r\n3.\r\nMesh topology is categorized into two parts: Fully connected mesh topology:\r\nIn this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other. Partially connected\r\nmesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other.\r\n4.\r\nIt is robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the specified computer\r\nconnected to this cable.\r\n5.\r\nMesh topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are difficult when\r\nconnectivity gets more.\r\n6.\r\nCabling cost is high as it requires bulk wiring.\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nTree :\r\n1.\r\nTree topology is a combination of star and bus topology. It is also known as the\r\nexpanded star topology.\r\n2.\r\nIn tree topology, all the star networks are connected to a single bus.\r\n3.\r\nEthernet protocol is used in this topology.\r\n4.\r\nIn this, the whole network is divided into segments known as star networks which\r\ncan be easily maintained. If one segment is damaged, there is no effect on other\r\nsegments.\r\n5.\r\nTree topology depends on the \"main bus,\" and if it breaks, then the whole\r\nnetwork gets damaged\r\n\u25cf\r\nHybrid :\r\n1.\r\nA hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies to form a resulting\r\ntopology.\r\n2.\r\nIf star topology is connected with another star topology, then it remains a star\r\ntopology. If star topology is connected with different topology, then it becomes a\r\nHybrid topology.\r\n3.\r\nIt provides flexibility as it can be implemented in a different network environment.\r\n\u25cf\r\nDifferent Types of Networks : (Imp) - Networks can be divided on the basis of area of\r\ndistribution. For example:\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nPAN (Personal Area Network): Its range limit is up to 10 meters. It is created for\r\npersonal use. Generally, personal devices are connected to this network.

It allows the creation of a secured tunnel\r\n(protected network) between different networks using the internet (public network). By\r\nusing the VPN, a client can connect to the organization\u2019s network remotely.\r\n\u25cf\r\nAdvantages of VPN :\r\n1.\r\nVPN is used to connect offices in different geographical locations remotely and is\r\ncheaper when compared to WAN connections.\r\n2.\r\nVPN is used for secure transactions and confidential data transfer between\r\nmultiple offices located in different geographical locations.\r\n3.\r\nVPN keeps an organization\u2019s information secured against any potential threats or\r\nintrusions by using virtualization.\r\n4.\r\nVPN encrypts the internet traffic and disguises the online identity.\r\n\u25cf\r\nTypes of VPN :\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nAccess VPN: Access VPN is used to provide connectivity to remote mobile users and\r\ntelecommuters. It serves as an alternative to dial-up connections or ISDN (Integrated\r\nServices Digital Network) connections. It is a low-cost solution and provides a wide\r\nrange of connectivity.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSite-to-Site VPN: A Site-to-Site or Router-to-Router VPN is commonly used in large\r\ncompanies having branches in different locations to connect the network of one office to\r\nanother in different locations. There are 2 sub-categories as mentioned below:\r\n\u25cf\r\nIntranet VPN: Intranet VPN is useful for connecting remote offices in different\r\ngeographical locations using shared infrastructure (internet connectivity and servers)\r\nwith the same accessibility policies as a private WAN (wide area network).\r\n\u25cf\r\nExtranet VPN: Extranet VPN uses shared infrastructure over an intranet, suppliers,\r\ncustomers, partners, and other entities and connects them using dedicated connections.\r\n\u25cf\r\nIPv4 Address : An IP address is a 32-bit dynamic address of a node in the network. An\r\nIPv4 address has 4 octets of 8-bit each with each number with a value up to 255. IPv4\r\nclasses are differentiated based on the number of hosts it supports on the network.\r\nThere are five types of IPv4 classes and are based on the first octet of IP addresses\r\nwhich are classified as Class A, B, C, D, or E.\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nOSI (Open System Interconnections) (Imp) : It is a network architecture model based\r\non the ISO standards. It is called the OSI model as it deals with connecting the systems\r\nthat are open for communication with other systems. The OSI model has seven layers.\r\nThe principles used to arrive at the seven layers can be summarized  briefly as below:\r\n1.\r\nCreate a new layer if a different abstraction is needed.\r\n2.\r\nEach layer should have a well-defined function.\r\n3.\r\nThe function of each layer is chosen based on internationally standardized\r\nprotocols.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSeven Layers

transfer of data from one node to another node.\r\nFunctions of Data-link layer:\r\n\u25cf\r\nFrame synchronization: Data-link layer converts the data into frames, and it ensures\r\nthat the destination must recognize the starting and ending of each frame.\r\n\u25cf\r\nFlow control: Data-link layer controls the data flow within the network.\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nError control: It detects and corrects the error occurred during the transmission from\r\nsource to destination.\r\n\u25cf\r\nAddressing: Data-link layers attach the physical address with the data frames so that\r\nthe individual machines can be easily identified.\r\n\u25cf\r\nLink management: Data-link layer manages the initiation, maintenance and termination\r\nof the link between the source and destination for the effective

Transport Layer\r\n\u25cf\r\nIt delivers the message through the network and provides error checking so that no error\r\noccurs during the transfer of data.\r\n\u25cf\r\nIt provides two kinds of services:\r\n\u25cb\r\nConnection-oriented transmission: In this transmission, the receiver sends the\r\nacknowledgement to the sender after the packet has been received.\r\n\r\n\u25cb\r\nConnectionless transmission: In this transmission, the receiver does not send\r\nthe acknowledgement to the sender.\r\n5. Session Layer\r\n\u25cf\r\nThe main responsibility of the session layer is beginning, maintaining and ending the\r\ncommunication between the devices.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSession layer also reports the error coming from the upper layers.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSession layer establishes and maintains the session between the two users.\r\n6. Presentation Layer\r\n\u25cf\r\nThe presentation layer is also known as a Translation layer as it translates the data from\r\none format to another format.\r\n\u25cf\r\nAt the sender side, this layer translates the data format used by the application layer to\r\nthe common format and at the receiver side, this layer translates the common format into\r\na format used by the application layer.\r\nFunctions of presentation layer:\r\n\u25cb\r\nCharacter code translation\r\n\u25cb\r\nData conversion\r\n\u25cb\r\nData compression\r\n\u25cb\r\nData encryption\r\n7. Application Layer\r\n\u25cf\r\nApplication layer enables the user to access the network.\r\n\u25cf\r\nIt is the topmost layer of the OSI reference model.\r\n\u25cf\r\nApplication layer protocols are file transfer protocol, simple mail transfer protocol,\r\ndomain name system, etc.\r\n\u25cf\r\nThe most widely used application protocol is HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol ). A user\r\nsends the request for the web page using HTTP.\r\n\r\n\u25cf\r\nTCP/IP Reference Model : It is a compressed version of the OSI model with only 4\r\nlayers. It was developed by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1860s. The\r\nname of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e. TCP (Transmission\r\nControl Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).\r\n1.\r\nLink : Decides which links such as serial lines or classic Ethernet must be used\r\nto meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer. Ex - Sonet, Ethernet\r\n2.\r\nInternet : The internet layer is the most important layer which holds the whole\r\narchitecture together. It delivers the IP packets where they are supposed to be\r\ndelivered.

It delivers the IP packets where they are supposed to be\r\ndelivered. Ex - IP, ICMP.\r\n3.\r\nTransport : Its functionality is almost the same as the OSI transport layer. It\r\nenables peer entities on the network to carry on a conversation. Ex - TCP, UDP\r\n(User Datagram Protocol)\r\n4.\r\nApplication : It contains all the higher-level protocols. Ex - HTTP, SMTP, RTP,\r\nDNS.\r\n\u25cf\r\nHTTP and HTTPS :\r\nHTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules and standards\r\non how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web (WWW).  It helps the\r\nweb browsers and web servers for communication. It is a \u2018stateless protocol\u2019 where each\r\ncommand is independent with respect to the previous command. HTTP is an\r\napplication layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default.\r\nHTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. It is an advanced\r\nand secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide\r\nsecurity. It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication and also\r\nhelps identify network servers securely. It uses port 443 by default.\r\n\u25cf\r\nDNS (Imp) :\r\n1.\r\nDNS is an acronym that stands for Domain Name System.DNS was introduced\r\nby Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in 1983.\r\n2.\r\nIt is a naming system for all the resources over the internet which includes\r\nphysical nodes and applications. It is used to locate resources easily over a\r\nnetwork.\r\n3.\r\nDNS is an internet which maps the domain names to their associated IP\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nWithout DNS, users must know the IP address of the web page that you wanted\r\nto access.\r\n\u25cf\r\nWorking of DNS (Imp): If you want to visit the website of \"shaurya\", then the user will\r\ntype \"https://www.shaurya.com\" into the address bar of the web browser. Once the\r\ndomain name is entered, then the domain name system will translate the domain name\r\ninto the IP address which can be easily interpreted by the computer. Using the IP\r\naddress, the computer can locate the web page requested by the user.\r\n\u25cf\r\nDNS Forwarder : A forwarder is used with a DNS server when it receives DNS queries\r\nthat cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards those requests to external DNS servers\r\nfor resolution. A DNS server which is configured as a forwarder will behave differently\r\nthan the DNS server which is not configured as a forwarder.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSMTP Protocol : SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP sets the rule for\r\ncommunication between servers. This set of rules helps the software to transmit emails\r\nover the internet. It supports both End-to-End and Store-and-Forward methods. It is in\r\nalways-listening mode on port 25.\r\n\u25cf\r\nDifference Between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram\r\nProtocol):\r\n1.\r\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless\r\nprotocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is\r\ncomparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and\r\nefficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible\r\nwith TCP\r\n2.\r\nTCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides\r\nflow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has only the basic error\r\nchecking mechanism using checksums.\r\n\r\nImportant Protocols\r\nA protocol is a set of rules which is used to govern all the aspects of information\r\ncommunication.The main elements of a protocol are:\r\n\u25cf\r\nSyntax: It specifies the structure or format of the data. It also specifies the order in which\r\nthey are presented.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSemantics: It specifies the meaning of each section of bits.\r\n\u25cf\r\nTiming: Timing specifies two characteristics: When data should be sent and how fast it\r\ncan be sent.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11436, "end_char_idx": 15830, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b018cb80-92cc-45d6-ba85-43022e3d8d4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b018cb80-92cc-45d6-ba85-43022e3d8d4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\acer\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbfx_1o9w.txt", "file_name": "tmpbfx_1o9w.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24590, "creation_date": "2025-07-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df2a65e5-2867-4e66-a14d-40d57483d2b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\acer\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbfx_1o9w.txt", "file_name": "tmpbfx_1o9w.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24590, "creation_date": "2025-07-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-29"}, "hash": "5a2f47c178915c7afc2ac4deb5a6bd28c4e7976455288c2fd6df1a4bc103ae35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecf7e26c-8b6b-42e7-a827-e42b62599ed2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\acer\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbfx_1o9w.txt", "file_name": "tmpbfx_1o9w.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24590, "creation_date": "2025-07-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-29"}, "hash": "363adcc76d60bde9d7ed12204d68bab6134cf2b219dda1cc28c1b0812505e950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bfe7538-3094-43e1-a893-15d148420c3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98d3e82f1892367feac0230e790e0ed45beea991595d6f3c97821c1dce72ee65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is\r\ncomparatively slower than UDP.

It is an application layer\r\nprotocol used to auto-configure devices on IP networks enabling them to use the TCP\r\nand UDP-based protocols. The DHCP servers auto-assign the IPs and other network\r\nconfigurations to the devices individually which enables them to communicate over the\r\nIP network. It helps to get the subnet mask, IP address and helps to resolve the DNS. It\r\nuses port 67 by default.\r\n\u25cf\r\nFTP : FTP is a File Transfer Protocol. It is an application layer protocol used to transfer\r\nfiles and data reliably and efficiently between hosts. It can also be used to download files\r\nfrom remote servers to your computer. It uses port 27 by default.\r\n\u25cf\r\nICMP : ICMP is the Internet Control Message Protocol. It is a network layer protocol\r\nused for error handling. It is mainly used by network devices like routers for diagnosing\r\nthe network connection issues and crucial for error reporting and testing if the data is\r\nreaching the preferred destination in time. It uses port 7 by default.\r\n\u25cf\r\nARP : ARP is Address Resolution Protocol. It is a network-level protocol used to\r\nconvert the logical address i.e. IP address to the device's physical address i.e. MAC\r\naddress. It can also be used to get the MAC address of devices when they are trying to\r\ncommunicate over the local network.\r\n\u25cf\r\nRIP :RIP stands for Routing Information Protocol. It is accessed by the routers to send\r\ndata from one network to another. RIP is a dynamic protocol which is used to find the\r\nbest route from source to the destination over a network by using the hop count\r\n\r\nalgorithm. Routers use this protocol to exchange the network topology information. This\r\nprotocol can be used by small or medium-sized networks.\r\n\u25cf\r\nMAC address and IP address (Imp) :\r\n1. Both MAC (Media Access Control) Address and IP Address are used to uniquely\r\ndefine a device on the internet. NIC Card\u2019s Manufacturer provides the MAC Address,\r\non the other hand Internet Service Provider provides IP Address.\r\n2. The main difference between MAC and IP address is that MAC Address is used to\r\nensure the physical address of a computer. It uniquely identifies the devices on a\r\nnetwork. While IP addresses are used to uniquely identify the connection of a network\r\nwith that device taking part in a network.\r\n\u25cf\r\nIpconfig and Ifconfig :\r\n1. Ipconfig : Internet Protocol Configuration, It is a command used in Microsoft operating\r\nsystems to view and configure network interfaces\r\n2. Ifconfig : Interface Configuration, It is a command used in MAC, Linux, UNIX operating\r\nsystems to view and configure network interfaces\r\n\u25cf\r\nFirewall : The firewall is a network security system that is used to monitor the incoming\r\nand outgoing traffic and blocks the same based on the firewall security policies. It acts as\r\na wall between the internet (public network) and the networking devices (a private\r\nnetwork). It is either a hardware device, software program, or a combination of both. It\r\nadds a layer of security to the network.\r\n\r\nImportant Key Points\r\n1.\r\nWhat happens when you enter google.com in the web browser?

Hub is operated on a\r\nPhysical layer. In this packet filtering is not available. It is of two types: Active Hub,\r\nPassive Hub.\r\nSwitch: Switch is a network device which is used to enable the connection\r\nestablishment and connection termination on the basis of need. Switch is operated on\r\nthe Data link layer. In this packet filtering is available. It is a type of full duplex\r\ntransmission mode and it is also called an efficient bridge.\r\n3.\r\nA subnet is a network inside a network achieved by the process called subnetting which\r\nhelps divide a network into subnets. It is used for getting a higher routing efficiency and\r\nenhances the security of the network. It reduces the time to extract the host address\r\nfrom the routing table.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nThe reliability of a network can be measured by the following factors:\r\n\u25cf\r\nDowntime: The downtime is defined as the required time to recover.\r\n\u25cf\r\nFailure Frequency: It is the frequency when it fails to work the way it is intended.\r\n\u25cf\r\nCatastrophe: It indicates that the network has been attacked by some unexpected event\r\nsuch as fire, earthquake.\r\n5. There are mainly two criteria which make a network effective and efficient:\r\n\u25cf\r\nPerformance : performance can be measured in many ways like transmit time and\r\nresponse time.\r\n\u25cf\r\nReliability: reliability is measured by frequency of failure.\r\n\u25cf\r\nRobustness: robustness specifies the quality or condition of being strong and in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\u25cf\r\nSecurity: It specifies how to protect data from unauthorized access and viruses.\r\n6. Node and Link : A network is a connection setup of two or more computers directly\r\nconnected by some physical mediums like optical fiber or coaxial cable. This physical\r\nmedium of connection is known as a link, and the computers that it is connected to are\r\nknown as nodes.\r\n7.\r\nGateway and router : A node that is connected to two or more networks is commonly\r\nknown as a gateway. It is also known as a router. It is used to forward messages from\r\none network to another. Both the gateway and router regulate the traffic in the\r\nnetwork. Differences between gateway and router: A router sends the data between\r\ntwo similar networks while gateway sends the data between two dissimilar networks.\r\n\r\n8.\r\nNIC (Imp) : NIC stands for Network Interface Card. It is a peripheral card attached to\r\nthe PC to connect to a network. Every NIC has its own MAC address that identifies the\r\nPC on the network. It provides a wireless connection to a local area network. NICs were\r\nmainly used in desktop computers.\r\n9.\r\nPOP3 stands for Post Office Protocol version3.
